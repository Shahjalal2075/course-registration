# Discuss State Managed

In this project I used UseState in 4 times.

First used in Courses.jsx page for JSON data received.
and useEffect use for JSON file connect on my project.

Second used in App.jsx page for set cart list data.

Third used in App.jsx page for set total credit count.

Fourth  used App.jsx page for set total price count.

Send a function App.jsx to Courses.jsx and Courses.jsx to Course.jsx page and set in onClick Method for received cart data.

received cart data to check multiple data and credit count and price count then set in useState variable. 

3 useState variable send to App.jsx to Carts.jsx and use this price,credit and cart item.
